Code to generate figures and tables in paper. 

- `sim_pp5.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-5BC on simulated families with family structures sampled from the HCP cohort. Corresponds to Figure 2 and Supplemental Table S2. 
- `sim_pp7.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-7 on simulated families (under full and sub-model assumptions) with family structures sampled from the HCP cohort. Corresponds to Supplemental Figure S1 and Supplemental Table S1. 
- `sim_pp11.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-11 on simulated families with family structures sampled from the HCP cohort. Corresponds to Figure 3 and Supplemental Table S3. 
- `sim_pp11_AUC.R`: Examine relationships between relative risks/allele frequencies and the AUCs from evaluating PanelPRO-11 on simulated families with family structures sampled from the HCP cohort. Corresponds to Figure 4 and Supplemental Table S4. 
- `sim_upper_pp5.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-5BC on simulated families with a large number of relatives. Corresponds to Figure 7 and Supplemental Table S7. 
- `sim_upper_pp11.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-11 on simulated families with a large number of relatives. Corresponds to Figure 8 and Supplemental Table S8. 
- `hcp_pp5.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-5BC on the HCP cohort. Corresponds to Figure 5 and Supplemental Table S5. 
- `hcp_pp11.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-11 on the HCP cohort. Corresponds to Figure 6 and Supplemental Table S6.
