Functions for simulating pedigrees, running PanelPRO models, and obtaining diagnostic metrics. They will be called as dependencies to run the simulation studies and data application. 

### Simulating Families
- `family_simulation_functions/`: Code to simulate detailed pedigrees, including family history of cancer, genotypes, and tumor marker testing results. The primary function, `sim.simFam`, can be found in `sim.simFam.R`. For further details, see the individual function documentation. 

### Functions and Code Shared Across Models
- `BackCompatibleDatabase.R`: Code to generate databases of model parameters/inputs that will return from PanelPRO<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> models that are back-compatible with models from the BayesMendel package<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>. 
- `run_model_functions.R`:  Functions that run models and extract carrier probability results for the simulation studies and data application. 
- `diagnostics_functions.R`: Functions for obtaining diagnostic metrics. 
- `combine_diagnostics_boot.R`: Code to load bootstrapped diagnostic metrics returned from separate cluster jobs. 
- `combine_subset_diagnostics_boot.R`: Code to load bootstrapped diagnostic metrics for a subset of families returned from separate cluster jobs. 

### Model-Specific Functions and Code
- `pp5/`: Functions and code specific to running PanelPRO-5BC. 
- `pp7/`: Functions and code specific to running PanelPRO-7. 
- `pp11/`: Functions and code specific to running PanelPRO-11. 

Each sub-directory contains the following files: 
- `diagnostics.R`: Code to obtain diagnostic metrics from evaluating models on simulated families. 
- `diagnostics_boot.R`: Code to obtain diagnostic metrics from 10 bootstrap samples. 

In addition, `pp5/` and `pp11/` contain the following files: 
- `diagnostics_hcp.R`: Code to obtain diagnostic metrics from evaluating models on families from the HCP cohort. 
- `subset_diagnostics.R`: Code to obtain diagnostic metrics from evaluating models on a subset of simulated families. 
- `subset_diagnostics_boot.R`: Code to obtain diagnostic metrics from 10 bootstrap samples of a subset of simulated families.
